# To Play

https://kqngo.github.io/tic-tac-toe-client

## Installation

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Change into the new directory.
3. Create and checkout a new branch, named playGame.
1. Install with `npm install`.
2. Start with `grunt serve`.
3. Open Chrome Browser to http://localhost:7165/


# The Task

Utilizing materials taught in a short intensive span of two weeks and two days at General Assembly-WDI, I have been tasked to write my first computer program, incorporating what I have learned so far in git, github, atom, HTLM, JavaScript (ES6), CSS, SCSS, SASS, JQuery, AJAX, and json using Rails backend, and grunt frontend webserver, to build a tic-tac-toe Single Page Application.  (This run on sentence is an attempt at capturing my anxiety and fear of the unknown as I trudge forward.)

Given 3 days of class time to deliver the following: https://kqngo.github.io/tic-tac-toe-client


# Goal (https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project)
At a high level, here are our goals for you in this project:
	• Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
	• Use your programming skills to map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
	• Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
	• Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
	• Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete 
	• Craft a readme.md file that explains your app to the world
Communicate with a back-end (Rails) to store the state of your game.

# Requirements

Requirements for this project can be found in the link listed below:

Requirements(https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project/blob/master/requirements.md)


## To Play Tic Tac Toe

1. Open a browser to : https://kqngo.github.io/tic-tac-toe-client
2. The first start the game as "X"
3. The second player "O" will be prompted to select an empty  square.
4. Contine to populate the squares on the grid to connect three squares in a row to win. Otherwise a tie will result.



## Objectives

By the time you submit this project, developers will have covered new ground in
many of the big themes of the course:

-   **Command Line**: Interacting with the computer and navigating the
    filesystem from the command line.
-   **Source Control**: Managing and interacting with a git repository to store
    changes to code.
-   **Programming Fundamentals**: Working with objects, constructors, and
    events, while learning how to strategically solve problems and resolve
    errors.
-   **Web Fundamentals**:  Structuring, styling, and animating documents within
    a browser; responding to actions your users take and the data they input
    into the browser.
-   **Browser Applications**: Using AJAX to connect to a back-end application.
-   **Server Applications**:  We haven't covered a ton of server-side
    technologies yet (that's up next), but we learned a bit about how API
    endpoints work, and how to get data from them.
-   **Security**: With JavaScript closures, scratching the surface of why
    security matters.
-   **Deployment**: Host a static web site in a managed hosting environment
    (GitHub Pages)
-   **Products and Teams**: Document your code and your code repository so
    others understand what you've built.

## Goals

At a high level, here are our goals for you in this project:

-   **Build a web application from scratch**, without a starter codebase
-   Use your programming skills to **map out the game logic for a simple game
    like Tic Tac Toe**
-   **Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files** in your application
-   Build an application **to a spec that someone else gives you**
-   **Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete** (bonus: compete
    from separate devices)
-   **Craft a ``readme.md`` file that explains your app** to the world
-   **Communicate with a back-end** (which we'll provide for you) to store the
    state of your game.

You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you
along the process and helping as you go. Everyone will get a chance to **be
creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges** to get
your feet wet in the world of web development. Those who dare will have the
tools to make it **multi-player, and multi-device** – so you can say to someone,
"hand me your phone," load up the game, and play a quick round!
