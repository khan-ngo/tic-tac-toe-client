# Ti c-Tac-Toe Project Client



## Installation

1. Install with `npm install`.
2. Start with `grunt serve`.


## Objectives

By the time you submit this project, developers will have covered new ground in
many of the big themes of the course:

-   **Command Line**: Interacting with the computer and navigating the
    filesystem from the command line.
-   **Source Control**: Managing and interacting with a git repository to store
    changes to code.
-   **Programming Fundamentals**: Working with objects, constructors, and
    events, while learning how to strategically solve problems and resolve
    errors.
-   **Web Fundamentals**:  Structuring, styling, and animating documents within
    a browser; responding to actions your users take and the data they input
    into the browser.
-   **Browser Applications**: Using AJAX to connect to a back-end application.
-   **Server Applications**:  We haven't covered a ton of server-side
    technologies yet (that's up next), but we learned a bit about how API
    endpoints work, and how to get data from them.
-   **Security**: With JavaScript closures, scratching the surface of why
    security matters.
-   **Deployment**: Host a static web site in a managed hosting environment
    (GitHub Pages)
-   **Products and Teams**: Document your code and your code repository so
    others understand what you've built.

## Goals

At a high level, here are our goals for you in this project:

-   **Build a web application from scratch**, without a starter codebase
-   Use your programming skills to **map out the game logic for a simple game
    like Tic Tac Toe**
-   **Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files** in your application
-   Build an application **to a spec that someone else gives you**
-   **Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete** (bonus: compete
    from separate devices)
-   **Craft a ``readme.md`` file that explains your app** to the world
-   **Communicate with a back-end** (which we'll provide for you) to store the
    state of your game.

You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you
along the process and helping as you go. Everyone will get a chance to **be
creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges** to get
your feet wet in the world of web development. Those who dare will have the
tools to make it **multi-player, and multi-device** – so you can say to someone,
"hand me your phone," load up the game, and play a quick round!
