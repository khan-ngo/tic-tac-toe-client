# The Task

Utilizing materials taught in a short intensive span of two weeks and two days at General Assembly-WDI, I have been tasked to write my first computer program, incorporating what I have learned so far in git, github, atom, HTLM, JavaScript (ES6), CSS, SCSS, SASS, JQuery, and AJAX using Rails backend, and grunt frontend webserver, to build a tic-tac-toe Single Page Application.  (This run on sentence is an attempt at capturing my anxiety and fear of the unknown as I trudge forward.)

Given 3 days of class time to deliver the following: https://kqngo.github.io/tic-tac-toe-client


# Goal (https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project)
At a high level, here are our goals for you in this project:
	• Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
	• Use your programming skills to map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
	• Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
	• Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
	• Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete 
	• Craft a readme.md file that explains your app to the world
Communicate with a back-end (Rails) to store the state of your game.

# Requirements
